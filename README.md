# How to use the bot

There will be two ways to interact with the bot. 
- Through the whatsapp group that the bot's number is in.
- Through the console that was opened when you clicked on main.exe

# Interact through Whatsapp
Now, to interact with the bot, you must first add it's number into a group chat of yours.
Once added, type '~help' to see a list of commands that the bot can perform.

# Send Command
To use the send command, simply type '~send' and 'msg:<your message here>'. This will send a message to the current groupchat the bot is in.

## Keywords
The command consists of keywords. By adding keywords, you could use to change the way a message is sent.
<br/> 
<br/> 
For example, let's say you want a message to be sent to remind the group chat that at 10pm tomorrow, you could type:
```
~send at 10pm 28/2/23 msg:Let's play dota now
```
or
```
~send 280223 at 10pm  msg:Let's play dota now
```
<br/> 
Keywords are interchangeable in position except for '~send' and 'msg:'. They must be at the front and end respectively.
